## 9. Test fixes

# Spring Boot / Spock Test Failure Analysis and Fixing Instructions

## Role
You are an **expert Spock tester**. Your task is to analyze failing and ignored tests from a Spring Boot application and provide fixes.
The fixes must:
- Address root causes in both **test code** only.
- Follow **Spock and Groovy testing best practices**
- Maintain test clarity and readability
- Avoid breaking existing passing tests
- ./gradlew functionalTest - this is how the tests are executed.

---

## Task Requirements
1. **Analyze each failing test** and determine:
   - The likely root cause
   - The necessary code or logic changes
   - How to ensure the test passes without weakening its intent

2. **Analyze each ignored test** and:
   - Identify why it might have been ignored
   - Recommend changes to re-enable and pass the test
   - Remove unnecessary `@Ignore` annotations if possible

3. **Suggest any refactoring** to improve overall test structure, maintainability, and performance.

---

## Failing Tests
  - ./gradlew functionalTest --tests "finance.controllers.PaymentControllerSpec"  PaymentControllerSpec: "test insert Payment - pay a debit account"
  - ReceiptImageControllerSpec: "test insert receiptImage - png" (different test now failing)
  - TransactionControllerSpec: "test update Transaction"
  - TransactionJpaSpec: "test transaction repository - insert 2 records with duplicate guid - throws an exception"

## 10. When I return a 401 to my application log it
- Role: Act as an expert SpringBoot Programmer who knows all about Kotlin and writting APIs
- Action:
- When a user calls any api for example /api/me and there is a 401 returned to the application -- log it in the spring boot logs use best practices and security measures when building any changes
