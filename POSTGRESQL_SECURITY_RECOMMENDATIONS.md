# PostgreSQL Security Recommendations

## Current Security Status

**Your application is already using secure authentication** ✓

The error message "no encryption" was misleading - it actually meant **no pg_hba.conf rule** existed, not that your connection wasn't encrypted. Now that we've added the rule with `scram-sha-256`, your connection uses:

1. **SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication** - Industry-standard password hashing (much stronger than MD5)
2. **HikariCP connection pooling** - With proper timeouts and leak detection
3. **Prepared statement caching** - Already configured in your datasource

## Recommendations for Enhanced Security

### 1. Add SSL/TLS Encryption for Data in Transit (Recommended)

Currently your database connections are **not encrypted in transit**. To add SSL:

**Add to your JDBC URL:**
```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql-server:5432/finance_db?sslmode=require&sslrootcert=/path/to/ca.crt
```

**SSL modes (in order of security):**
- `disable` - No SSL (current)
- `allow` - Try SSL, fall back to non-SSL
- `prefer` - Try SSL first, fall back if needed
- `require` - Require SSL (recommended minimum)
- `verify-ca` - Require SSL + verify CA certificate
- `verify-full` - Require SSL + verify CA + verify hostname (most secure)

### 2. PostgreSQL SSL Configuration

You'd need to configure SSL in PostgreSQL:

**Update pg_hba.conf to require SSL:**
```conf
hostssl all all all scram-sha-256
```

**Generate/configure SSL certificates in PostgreSQL 18:**

```bash
# Generate self-signed certificate (for development/testing)
openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -text \
  -out server.crt \
  -keyout server.key \
  -subj "/CN=postgresql-server"

# Set proper permissions
chmod 600 server.key
chown postgres:postgres server.key server.crt

# Copy to PostgreSQL data directory
cp server.crt server.key /home/henninb/postgresql-data/

# Update postgresql.conf
echo "ssl = on" >> /home/henninb/postgresql-data/postgresql.conf
echo "ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'" >> /home/henninb/postgresql-data/postgresql.conf
echo "ssl_key_file = 'server.key'" >> /home/henninb/postgresql-data/postgresql.conf

# Restart PostgreSQL
docker restart postgresql-server
```

### 3. Connection String Security Parameters

Add these to your datasource URL for additional security:

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:postgresql://postgresql-server:5432/finance_db?sslmode=require&ApplicationName=raspi-finance-endpoint&assumeMinServerVersion=18.0&options=-c%20statement_timeout=30000
```

**Parameters explained:**
- `sslmode=require` - Enforce SSL encryption
- `ApplicationName` - Identify your application in PostgreSQL logs
- `assumeMinServerVersion` - Skip version check for faster connections
- `statement_timeout` - Additional query timeout protection

### 4. Additional Security Hardening

**Environment Variable Security:**
```bash
# Use strong, unique passwords
export DATASOURCE_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Rotate JWT keys regularly
export JWT_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 64)

# Store in encrypted secrets manager (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
```

**Database User Permissions:**
```sql
-- Create application-specific user with minimal privileges
CREATE USER finance_app WITH PASSWORD 'strong_password';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE finance_db TO finance_app;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO finance_app;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO finance_app;
GRANT USAGE, SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO finance_app;

-- Revoke superuser privileges if henninb has them
ALTER USER henninb WITH NOSUPERUSER;
```

**Network Security:**
```conf
# Restrict pg_hba.conf to specific Docker network
host all all 172.19.0.0/16 scram-sha-256

# Or even more restrictive - specific IP only
host all all 172.19.0.3/32 scram-sha-256
```

## Do You NEED to Change Anything Now?

**No, your current setup is secure enough for most use cases:**

✓ SCRAM-SHA-256 password authentication (secure)
✓ Connection pooling with timeouts
✓ Strong password requirements
✓ Network isolation (Docker network)
✓ Query timeouts configured
✓ Circuit breaker and retry patterns
✓ Connection leak detection

**Consider adding SSL if:**
- Your database is exposed beyond Docker networks
- You handle highly sensitive financial data (PCI compliance)
- You need compliance with specific security standards (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.)
- Network traffic could be intercepted
- You're running in a multi-tenant environment

## Security Checklist

### Already Implemented ✓
- [x] SCRAM-SHA-256 password authentication
- [x] HikariCP connection pooling with leak detection
- [x] Query timeouts (30 seconds)
- [x] Connection timeouts (20 seconds)
- [x] Statement timeouts configured
- [x] Circuit breaker patterns (Resilience4j)
- [x] Retry logic with exponential backoff
- [x] Network isolation via Docker networks
- [x] JWT authentication for API endpoints
- [x] Rate limiting (5000 RPM default)
- [x] CORS policy configured

### Recommended Enhancements
- [ ] SSL/TLS encryption for database connections
- [ ] Certificate-based authentication
- [ ] Database connection encryption at rest
- [ ] Secrets management system (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- [ ] Regular password rotation policy
- [ ] Audit logging for database access
- [ ] Database activity monitoring
- [ ] Principle of least privilege (dedicated app user)

### Optional Advanced Security
- [ ] Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication
- [ ] Database connection encryption with custom certificates
- [ ] IP allowlisting at firewall level
- [ ] Database query auditing and anomaly detection
- [ ] Penetration testing and security scanning
- [ ] SIEM integration for security monitoring

## Implementation Priority

**High Priority (Do Soon):**
1. SSL/TLS encryption for production deployments
2. Dedicated application database user with minimal privileges
3. Regular security patches and updates

**Medium Priority (Plan For):**
1. Secrets management system
2. Certificate rotation automation
3. Database audit logging

**Low Priority (Nice to Have):**
1. Mutual TLS authentication
2. Advanced monitoring and alerting
3. Compliance automation

## Notes

- For a self-hosted application on a private Docker network, **your current configuration is already quite secure**
- The main vulnerability would be if someone gains access to your Docker network, but SSL wouldn't help much in that scenario anyway
- SSL adds overhead (~5-10% performance impact) - balance security needs with performance requirements
- Regular updates and patch management are more important than additional encryption layers for internal networks
