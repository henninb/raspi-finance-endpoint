// Legacy GraphQL provider configuration - REMOVED for Spring Boot 4.0 migration
// This file contained legacy third-party GraphQL configuration that is incompatible with Spring Boot 4.0
// GraphQL functionality is now handled by:
// 1. GraphQLWiringConfig.kt - Runtime wiring configuration for Spring Boot 4.0
// 2. Official spring-boot-starter-graphql auto-configuration
// 3. GraphQL resolvers in finance.resolvers package

// File deleted - functionality migrated to Spring Boot 4.0 official GraphQL support
